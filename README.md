# coin-flipper

This is a coin flipper app.

Implement a function, routine or method (and the support code you might need)
that simulates 6 tosses of 3 coins each and outputs a string according to the
Value Rules below. 

## Value Rules

 a. Tails has a value of 2, and heads a value of 3.
 b. Get the total value of the three coins per toss.
 c. Compose a string with these values in reverse order, from toss 6 to 1.

    Example output: “767777”
